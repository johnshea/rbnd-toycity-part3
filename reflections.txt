How long did you spend working on this project?

- 3.0 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

- Finding and figuring out how to use methods none?, find, and find_all

What two additional features did you build? Why?

- Product class method - Product.items_to_reorder(threshold) - Returns an array of products that need to be reordered if their quantity <= threshold value
  - Why? Makes it easy to know what to reorder when restocking the store

- Transaction class method - Transaction.find_all_by_customer(customer) - Returns an array of all transactions for the customer
  - Why? Can quickly see what products a customer is buying and how many things they have purchased

Where do you still have room to grow?

- Commit more things to memory so I don't have to refer to the docs as often
- Learn more methods that are unique to Ruby to make my code more efficient
